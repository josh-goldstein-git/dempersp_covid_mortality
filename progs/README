These 'R' scripts generate the figures and the tables for "Demographic Perspectives and the Mortality of Covid-19 and other Epidemics."

The 00-prep_data.R script produces cleaned data sets used by the other scripts. It only needs to be run once. 

The scripts to generate figures and tables are self-contained.
