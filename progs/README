In this file, we should explain what each .R program does and how to
source() all of them to reproduce the figures and calculations in the
paper.


Note some of these files produce clean data (and don't necessarily have to be run everytime).
These are:
-- harmonize_covid_deaths.R --> ../data/cleaned/harmonize_covid_deaths.csv
-- get_cohort_ex_period_2020.R --> ../data/cleaned/cohort_ex_period_2020.csv

Others do calculations and produce figures.
